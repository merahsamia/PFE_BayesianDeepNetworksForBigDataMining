Bayesian Deep Networks:
Bayesian Deep Learning - Images classification 
#
The objective of our project is to implement deep Bayesian networks by proposing an adequate approach (The approach of Monte Carlo Dropout) to provide high predictive performance. To do this, we took advantage of the Deep Learning philosophy (convolutive neural networks) to abstract observed characteristics and improve the classification of an image data set. In addition, we adopted the Bayesian network principle in order to make use of their uncertainty.
